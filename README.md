# [soundPlay](https://github.com/zerosignalproductions/soundPlay) 

v.01

## Purpose

soundPlay is a Google Music-like interface for streaming music off of SoundCloud. It's based off of ngBoilerplate, which in turn, is based off of the following:

* [Twitter Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com)
* [Angular UI](http://angular-ui.github.io)
* [Angular Bootstrap](http://angular-ui.github.io/bootstrap)
* [Font Awesome](http://fortawesome.github.com/Font-Awesome)
* [LESS](http://lesscss.org)
* [Grunt](http://gruntjs.org)

And an addition of my own:

* [Angular Audio Player](https://github.com/mrgamer/angular-audio-player/)

## Roadmap

I'd love to be able to have users sign in and be able to create their own playlists, but that's probably out of scope for the near future.
