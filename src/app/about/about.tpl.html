  <p>soundPlay is a simple app to pull random playlists from SoundCloud. The idea for this app came from Josh over at <a href="http://listen2edm.com">Listen2EDM</a></p>

  <p>If you're into electronic music, go give his site a look.</p>

  <h3>What's behind it?</h3>
  <p>I'm using AngularJS, Bootstrap, and NodeJS to power the website. All of the data is pulled from the SoundCloud API.</p>

  <h3>What about new features?</h3>
  <p>Send me an email or hit me up on Github if you'd like to see any new features or come across any bugs.</p>

  <h3>Why are there bugs?</h3>
  <p>This is just a side project for fun, so there will definitely be bugs. Send me an email if you find anything.</p>
