    What is Listen2EDM?
  </h1>
  
  <p>Listen2EDM is a playlist for all the tracks from on the EDM.com network.</p>
  <h4>Doesn't that defeat the purpose of the EDM.com network of sites?</h4>
  <p>Not if you just want to listen to music.</p>
  <h4>Why can't I x, y, or z? Why is it so ugly?</h4>
  <p>Because I want to see if people like the idea of it first before I invest some time into it.</p>
  <h4>Is this illegal?</h4>
  <p>Nope, just streaming shit from SoundCloud.</p>
  <h4>Again, doesn't that defeat the purpose of EDM.com and their sister sites?</h4>
  <p>Again... Not if you just want to listen to music.</p>
  <h4>I like this. Will it always be free?</h4>
  <p>Yep. I won't even think about putting ads on it.</p>
  <h4>Who are you?</h4>
  <p>Some kid named Josh Brody from Minneapolis. Feel free to creep or network.

  <h4>You seem smart. Do you do anything else?</h4>
  <p>Yeah, I do. Lots of things.</p>

  <h4>Are you available for work?</h4>
  <p>Yep. I'm currently broke as a joke paying out-of-pocket for my mom's chemo. It's depressing. I cleared out $150k+ paying for her <i>"specialized treatments"</i> and that only took 5 months to do. I'll take any work I can get right now.</p>
